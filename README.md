# Attendance-Management-System
The Attendance Management System (AMS) is a class project built with Python (Flask) and SQLite for student attendance tracking. It generates dynamic QR codes for each session, which students scan to mark attendance. Role-based access allows secure authentication, class scheduling, and attendance monitoring.
